It is a drawing on flat surface that looks a lot like the real world, but way smaller. But size is not the only aspect in which maps are not like the real world. On a road map, we show the roads extra wide compared to other features. Also, the colors of features on a map are often completely different than the real world things they represent. In what way they are different is determined by the goal of the map in case. One of the things on a map that are always different form reality is actually the shape of everything on it.
